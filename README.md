Speed up the creation and maintenance of your JS applications. Zero configuration way to use modern code-quality tools.

+ **Zero-config.** Any tool already configured for you.
+ **Universal.** Supports TS, React, and can be used with any tech.
+ **Uniform.** Config can be shared (all projects have the same configs).

## TL;DR

```sh
yarn add -D @solid-soda/scripts
```

## Motivation

1. Before start to code we must set-up ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, Commitizen, etc. We can to automate all this. Machines have to suffer.
2. New lint rule adding is a hell. We provide the one source of true for any project. Just bump `@solid-soda/scripts` in your project and run upgrade-script.
